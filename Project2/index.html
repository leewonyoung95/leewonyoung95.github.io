      <h4><strong>Pasta</strong></h4>
      <p>specially cream pasta </p>
      <p>Also commonly used to refer to the variety of pasta dishes, pasta is typically made from an unleavened dough of a durum wheat flour mixed with water or eggs and formed into sheets or various shapes, then cooked by boiling or baking. As an alternative for those wanting a different taste, or who need to avoid products containing gluten, some pastas can be made using rice flour in place of wheat.[3][4] Pastas may be divided into two broad categories, dried (pasta secca) and fresh (pasta fresca).</p>

         referring to what appears to be three layers that are visible in the meat. The word o  in ogyeop-sal means "five", referring to the five-layered pork belly meat with the skin-on.</p>
